# FootballReminder
One of my first side projects, but dependency injectified with configuration, logging services, as well as two of my own. 
Dives into an api of football matches and picks out specific matches of interest, specified in appsettings.json.
Then makes requests to the Google Calendar Api to add them to my gcal.
