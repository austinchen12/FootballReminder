# FootballReminder
One of my first side projects, but dependency injectified with configuration, logging services, as well as two of my own. 
Dives into an API for soccer/football data and picks out specific matches of interest, specified in appsettings.json.
Then makes requests to a calendar API, currently using gcal.
